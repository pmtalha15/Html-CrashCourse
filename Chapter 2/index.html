        Filmmaker Vipul Shah wonders what's in a number. After his recent controversial production, The Kerala Story, claimed to tell stories of more than 32,000 Kerala women whoâ€™d allegedly been radicalised by Islamic fundamentalists, only to later backtrack and change the number to "three", Shah says for him the factual figures don't matter.
        
        The Kerala Story, director Sudipto Sen's feature, has found itself in a political storm with backlash over its inaccurate portrayal of the people of the state. Recently, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee banned the screening of the controversial movie to avoid any incident of hatred and violence.</pre>
